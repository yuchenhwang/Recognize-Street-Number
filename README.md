# Recognize Street Number
Welcome to the project on classification using Convolutional Neural Networks. We will work with the Street View Housing Numbers (SVHN) image dataset for this project.

## Context:
One of the most interesting tasks in deep learning is to recognize objects in natural scenes. The ability to process visual information using machine learning algorithms can be very useful as demonstrated in various applications.

The SVHN dataset contains over 600,000 labeled digits cropped from street-level photos. It is one of the most popular image recognition datasets. It has been used in neural networks created by Google to improve map quality by automatically transcribing the address numbers from a patch of pixels. The transcribed number with a known street address helps pinpoint the location of the building it represents.

## Objective:
Build a CNN model that can identify the digits in the images.

## Dataset:
A subset of the original data is used here to save some computation time in this project. The dataset is provided as a .h5 file. The basic preprocessing steps have been done.
